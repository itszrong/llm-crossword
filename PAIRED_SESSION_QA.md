## Expected Questions & Answers

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture & Design Patterns**

**Q: Can you walk me through the overall architecture of your solution?**

**A:** The solution implements a **multi-agent agentic design pattern** with four specialized agents:

1. **ClueAgent** - Generates candidate answers using LLM reasoning and different solving strategies
2. **ConstraintAgent** - Validates answers against grid constraints and cross-references 
3. **ReviewAgent** - Performs quality control and conflict resolution
4. **CoordinatorAgent** - Orchestrates the entire solving process and manages state

The architecture follows these key principles:
- **Separation of concerns**: Each agent has a specific responsibility
- **Tool use pattern**: LLM-powered reasoning with structured outputs
- **Memory management**: Comprehensive state tracking and logging
- **Graceful degradation**: Retry logic and fallback strategies

**Q: What agentic design patterns did you implement?**

**A:** I implemented several key agentic patterns:

- **Tool Use**: LLM calls with structured prompts for clue solving and validation
- **Multi-Agent**: Specialized agents working together with defined interfaces
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Step-by-step reasoning for complex clues
- **Memory & State Management**: Tracking candidates, conflicts, and solving history
- **Exception Handling**: Retry mechanisms and graceful error recovery
- **Reflection**: Review agent validates and improves solutions

### üß© **Solving Strategy**

**Q: How does your solver approach different types of clues?**

**A:** The solver uses **clue type classification** and **specialized prompting**:

```python
def _classify_clue_type(self, clue_text: str) -> str:
    # Identifies: definition, wordplay, cryptic, anagram, etc.
```

For each type, it uses different reasoning strategies:
- **Definition clues**: Direct synonym/definition lookup
- **Wordplay clues**: Pattern recognition and linguistic tricks
- **Cryptic clues**: Multi-layer analysis (definition + wordplay)
- **Anagram clues**: Letter rearrangement with indicator words

**Q: How do you handle conflicts between intersecting words?**

**A:** The `ConstraintAgent` implements sophisticated **conflict resolution**:

1. **Detection**: Identifies conflicting characters at intersections
2. **Analysis**: Evaluates confidence scores of competing answers
3. **Resolution**: Uses multiple strategies:
   - Prefer higher confidence candidates
   - Analyze cross-reference strength
   - Consider clue difficulty
   - Apply constraint propagation

```python
def resolve_conflicts(self, state: SolverState) -> List[Tuple[int, str]]
```

### üéØ **Code Quality & Testing**

**Q: How did you structure your code for maintainability?**

**A:** The codebase follows **clean architecture principles**:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ crossword/          # Core puzzle domain logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ crossword.py   # CrosswordPuzzle class
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.py       # Data models (Clue, Cell, Grid)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.py       # Utility functions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ solver/            # Agentic solving logic
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents.py      # Multi-agent implementation
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main_solver.py # Integration interface
```

Key design decisions:
- **Pydantic models** for type safety and validation
- **Dataclasses** for structured state management
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging and analysis
- **Modular agent design** for easy extension

**Q: How do you test and validate your solution?**

**A:** Multiple validation layers:

1. **Unit testing**: Individual agent functionality
2. **Integration testing**: Full solver pipeline (`test_agentic_solver.py`)
3. **Progressive difficulty**: Easy ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Hard ‚Üí Cryptic
4. **Comprehensive metrics**: Completion rate, solving time, accuracy
5. **Detailed logging**: JSON logs for post-analysis

```python
def solve_with_stats(self, puzzle, puzzle_name, log_path) -> dict:
    # Returns detailed performance metrics
```

### üîß **Implementation Details**

**Q: How do you manage the LLM interactions?**

**A:** Structured **prompt engineering** with context awareness:

```python
def _build_clue_prompt(self, clue: Clue, context: str, clue_type: str) -> str:
    # Context-aware prompts based on:
    # - Clue type (definition, cryptic, wordplay)
    # - Grid state (intersecting letters)
    # - Solving progress
```

**Error handling and reliability**:
- Exponential backoff for API failures
- Retry logic with degraded prompts
- Fallback to simpler solving strategies

**Q: What would you optimize if you had more time?**

**A:** Priority improvements:

1. **Performance**: 
   - Parallel agent execution
   - Caching for repeated clue patterns
   - Smarter candidate pruning

2. **Intelligence**:
   - Fine-tuned models for crossword-specific tasks
   - Better pattern recognition for cryptic clues
   - Learning from solving history

3. **Robustness**:
   - More sophisticated conflict resolution
   - Dynamic strategy selection based on puzzle type
   - Better handling of partial solutions

### üöÄ **Extension Points**

**Q: How would you extend this for different puzzle types?**

**A:** The modular design supports easy extension:

```python
class SpecializedAgent(BaseAgent):
    def solve_clue(self, clue: Clue, context: str) -> List[ClueCandidate]:
        # Puzzle-specific logic
```

Potential extensions:
- **Different grid sizes/shapes**
- **Themed puzzles** (sports, movies, etc.)
- **Multi-language support**
- **Real-time collaborative solving**

**Q: What about scalability and production deployment?**

**A:** Architecture supports scaling:

- **Async agents**: Can process multiple clues concurrently
- **State persistence**: JSON logging enables resume/replay
- **API integration**: Clean interfaces for web services
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and logging
