Two-Stage Review System for Crossword Solving

This module implements a review agent that analyzes failed/partial solutions
and a correction agent that attempts to fix remaining issues using insights
from the complete solving history.

AGENTIC DESIGN PATTERNS USED:
===========================================

1. MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM: ReviewAgent + CorrectionAgent + TwoStageReviewSystem
   - Multiple specialized agents working together
   - Each agent has distinct responsibilities and capabilities

2. REFLECTION PATTERN: ReviewAgent analyzes solving process and outcomes
   - Self-assessment of performance and failure modes
   - Meta-cognitive analysis of what went wrong

3. HIERARCHICAL AGENT STRUCTURE: TwoStageReviewSystem coordinates sub-agents
   - Orchestrator pattern managing workflow between agents
   - Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities

4. TOOL-USING AGENTS: Both agents use CrosswordTools for LLM interactions
   - Agents augmented with external tools and capabilities
   - Consistent interface for AI model interactions

5. MEMORY/CONTEXT PATTERN: Comprehensive logging and state tracking
   - Rich historical context from SolverLog
   - Persistent insights and decision tracking

KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS & TRADEOFFS:
=====================================

1. TWO-STAGE DESIGN (Review ‚Üí Correction)
   DECISION: Separate analysis from action
   TRADEOFF: 
   ‚úÖ PRO: Clear separation of concerns, better debugging, modular
   ‚ùå CON: More complexity, additional LLM calls, latency
   ALTERNATIVE: Single-stage agent doing both review and correction
   
2. TRIGGER-BASED ACTIVATION (Only when stuck)
   DECISION: Only activate review when solver makes no progress
   TRADEOFF:
   ‚úÖ PRO: Reduces unnecessary LLM calls, cost-efficient, targeted intervention
   ‚ùå CON: May miss early opportunities for correction, reactive vs proactive
   ALTERNATIVE: Always-on review after each iteration
   
3. DIFFICULTY-SPECIFIC ENABLEMENT (Hard/Cryptic only)
   DECISION: Auto-enable only for difficult puzzles
   TRADEOFF:
   ‚úÖ PRO: Resource efficient, targeted where most needed
   ‚ùå CON: May miss benefits on easier puzzles, less consistent behavior
   ALTERNATIVE: Enable for all difficulties
   
4. LIMITED CORRECTION ATTEMPTS (Max 3 corrections)
   DECISION: Cap the number of correction attempts
   TRADEOFF:
   ‚úÖ PRO: Prevents infinite loops, bounds cost, faster termination
   ‚ùå CON: May miss solutions requiring more attempts
   ALTERNATIVE: Unlimited attempts with other stopping criteria
   
5. PRIORITIZED CLUE SELECTION (Score-based ranking)
   DECISION: Focus on highest-impact clues first
   TRADEOFF:
   ‚úÖ PRO: Maximizes improvement per attempt, efficient resource usage
   ‚ùå CON: May miss cascading effects from lower-priority clues
   ALTERNATIVE: Random selection or breadth-first approach
   
6. SEMANTIC VERIFICATION THRESHOLD (Only <80% completion)
   DECISION: Skip expensive semantic checks when mostly solved
   TRADEOFF:
   ‚úÖ PRO: Reduces LLM calls when puzzle is nearly complete
   ‚ùå CON: May miss semantic errors in late-stage solving
   ALTERNATIVE: Always verify or use completion-rate-based thresholds

Please generate 5 alternative answers that:
1. Fit the pattern constraints
2. Address the identified issues
3. Make semantic sense for the clue
4. Are valid crossword answers

Format each answer on a new line with just the word (uppercase).

COMPREHENSIVE DECISION FRAMEWORK SUMMARY:
=======================================

PERFORMANCE vs COST TRADEOFFS:
1. Trigger-based activation: Only when stuck (cost-efficient)
2. Limited correction attempts: Max 3 (bounded cost)
3. Conditional semantic verification: Skip when >80% complete
4. Difficulty-specific enablement: Hard/Cryptic only

ACCURACY vs EFFICIENCY TRADEOFFS:
1. Two-stage design: Separate analysis/action (better accuracy, more complex)
2. Prioritized clue selection: High-impact first (efficiency over completeness)
3. Pattern-guided corrections: Use constraints to narrow search space

ROBUSTNESS vs SIMPLICITY TRADEOFFS:
1. Multi-agent architecture: More robust but complex coordination
2. Structured insight representation: Systematic but overhead
3. Comprehensive logging: Full observability but storage cost

DESIGN PATTERN ADVANTAGES:
‚úÖ Reflection Pattern: Self-improvement capability
‚úÖ Multi-Agent System: Specialized expertise, parallel processing
‚úÖ Hierarchical Structure: Clear responsibilities, coordinated action
‚úÖ Tool-Using Agents: Leverages LLM capabilities effectively
‚úÖ Memory/Context: Rich historical awareness

POTENTIAL INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & RESPONSES:

Q: "Why two agents instead of one?"
A: "Separation of analysis and action. ReviewAgent focuses on understanding 
   what went wrong, CorrectionAgent focuses on fixing it. This enables 
   specialized reasoning and better debugging."

Q: "How do you prevent infinite correction loops?"
A: "Multiple safeguards: max 3 correction attempts, progress tracking,
   trigger conditions (only when stuck), and bounded search space."

Q: "What about computational costs?"
A: "Designed for efficiency: trigger-based activation, conditional analysis,
   difficulty-specific enablement, limited attempts. Only activates when
   needed most (hard puzzles that are stuck)."

Q: "How do you handle scaling to larger puzzles?"
A: "Prioritized analysis focuses on highest-impact clues first. Structured
   insights enable efficient processing. Limited scope prevents exponential
   growth."

Q: "What are the failure modes?"
A: "Could miss early intervention opportunities (reactive), may not solve
   issues requiring >3 attempts, semantic verification threshold could miss
   late-stage errors. Trade-offs are documented and measurable."
