Agentic Crossword Solver using Multi-Agent Design Patterns

This implementation incorporates several agentic design patterns:
- Tool Use: LLM-powered clue solving and constraint validation
- Multi-Agent: Specialized agents for different aspects of solving
- Reasoning Techniques: Chain-of-thought for complex clues
- Memory Management: State tracking and candidate management
- Exception Handling: Retry logic and graceful degradation

🚨 ITERATION {iteration} - PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS FAILED!
- You have tried {iteration - 1} times and failed
- CRITICAL: Answer must be EXACTLY {clue.length} letters, no more, no less
- Common errors to avoid: adding extra words, wrong length, complex phrases
- Focus on SIMPLE, DIRECT answers that fit the exact length requirement
- For multi-word clues like (7,3), provide ONE word with NO SPACES

STRATEGIC THINKING FOR MULTI-WORD CLUES:
- Look for compound words, proper names, or phrases written as one word
- Consider famous titles, technical terms, or well-known expressions
- Think about how two words might combine into a single crossword answer
- Example patterns: FIRSTNAME+LASTNAME, ADJECTIVE+NOUN, etc.
- Double-check your answer has EXACTLY {clue.length} letters before submitting

APPROACH:
1. Break down the clue into its component meanings
2. Think of what concepts or entities fit those meanings
3. Consider how they might be expressed as a single {clue.length}-letter word
4. Verify the word makes logical sense for the clue

CHAIN OF THOUGHT REASONING REQUIRED:
1. Analyze the known letters and their positions
2. Consider what words could fit this specific pattern
3. Match against the clue meaning
4. Verify the word makes semantic sense
5. Double-check every letter position matches the pattern

PATTERN ANALYSIS STRATEGY:
- Look for common letter combinations in the known positions

- Use the pattern to eliminate impossible candidates early

Solve this crossword clue:
Clue: "{clue.text}"
{length_info}
Direction: {clue.direction}

{context}
{history_section}
{pattern_section}
{knowledge_section}

IMPORTANT: 
- If the clue has parentheses like (7,3), it indicates a two-word answer written as one
- For multi-word answers, combine words WITHOUT spaces (compound words, proper names, titles)
- Single-word answers should be exactly {clue.length} letters with no spaces
- Double-check that your answer matches the required length
- Think about common crossword answers and wordplay patterns
- For simple clues, prefer obvious, common words over obscure ones

MANDATORY CHAIN OF THOUGHT REASONING:
Step 1: PATTERN ANALYSIS (if pattern exists)
- Examine each known letter and its position
- Identify letter combinations that suggest specific words
- Consider common prefixes/suffixes that fit the pattern
- Note any impossible letter combinations

Step 2: CLUE ANALYSIS
- Break down the clue into its core meaning(s)
- Identify the category (person, place, thing, concept, action)
- Look for wordplay hints or double meanings
- Consider alternative interpretations

Step 3: CANDIDATE GENERATION
- Generate words that fit both the pattern AND the clue meaning
- For multi-word clues: think compound words, proper names, technical terms
- Consider famous titles, names, or phrases written as one word
- Use pattern constraints to eliminate impossible options

Step 4: VALIDATION
- Check each candidate letter-by-letter against the pattern
- Verify the semantic fit with the clue
- Confirm the word length matches exactly
- Ensure it's a reasonable crossword answer

Step 5: CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
- HIGH: Perfect pattern match + clear semantic fit
- MEDIUM: Good pattern match + reasonable semantic fit  
- LOW: Partial fit or uncertain semantic connection

REQUIRED FORMAT - SHOW YOUR CHAIN OF THOUGHT:

PATTERN ANALYSIS: [analyze the pattern if one exists]
CLUE BREAKDOWN: [break down the clue meaning]
REASONING CHAIN: [walk through your logic step by step]

Then provide your candidates:
ANSWER: [word] | CONFIDENCE: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | PATTERN CHECK: [verify letter by letter]
ALT1: [word] | CONFIDENCE: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | PATTERN CHECK: [verify letter by letter]
ALT2: [word] | CONFIDENCE: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | PATTERN CHECK: [verify letter by letter]

Example for a pattern like "O_D_P_S":
PATTERN ANALYSIS: Starts with O, has D in position 3, P in position 5, S at end
CLUE BREAKDOWN: Greek tragedy - famous classical work
REASONING CHAIN: Greek tragedies → Sophocles plays → Oedipus Rex → fits O_D_P_S pattern perfectly
ANSWER: OEDIPUS | CONFIDENCE: HIGH | PATTERN CHECK: O(1)E(2)D(3)I(4)P(5)U(6)S(7) - matches O_D_P_S
